#' Posterior uncertainty intervals
#'
#' For models fit using MCMC (\code{algorithm="sampling"}) or one of the
#' variational approximations (\code{"meanfield"} or \code{"fullrank"}), the
#' \code{posterior_interval} function computes Bayesian posterior uncertainty
#' intervals. These intervals are often referred to as \emph{credible}
#' intervals, but we use the term \emph{uncertainty} intervals to highlight the
#' fact that wider intervals correspond to greater uncertainty.
#'
#' @aliases posterior_interval

#' 
#' @param prob A number \eqn{p \in (0,1)}{p (0 < p < 1)} indicating the desired
#'   probability mass to include in the intervals. The default is to report
#'   \eqn{90}\% intervals (\code{prob=0.9}) rather than the traditionally used
#'   \eqn{95}\% (see Details).
#' @param type The type of interval to compute. Currently the only option is
#'   \code{"central"} (see Details). A central \eqn{100p}\%
#'   interval is defined by the \eqn{\alpha/2} and \eqn{1 - \alpha/2} quantiles,
#'   where \eqn{\alpha = 1 - p}.
#'
#' @return A matrix with two columns and as many rows as model parameters (or
#'   the subset of parameters specified by \code{pars} and/or
#'   \code{regex_pars}). For a given value of \code{prob}, \eqn{p}, the columns
#'   correspond to the lower and upper \eqn{100p}\% interval limits and have the
#'   names \eqn{100\alpha/2}\% and \eqn{100(1 - \alpha/2)}\%, where \eqn{\alpha
#'   = 1-p}. For example, if \code{prob=0.9} is specified (a \eqn{90}\%
#'   interval), then the column names will be \code{"5\%"} and \code{"95\%"},
#'   respectively.
#' @param ... additional params (currently not being used)
#' @param object an lgt object

#' \subsection{Interpretation}{
#' Unlike for a frenquentist confidence interval, it is valid to say that,
#' conditional on the data and model, we believe that with probability \eqn{p}
#' the value of a parameter is in its \eqn{100p}\% posterior interval. This
#' intuitive interpretation of Bayesian intervals is often erroneously applied
#' to frequentist confidence intervals. See Morey et al. (2015) for more details
#' on this issue and the advantages of using Bayesian posterior uncertainty
#' intervals (also known as credible intervals).
#' }
#' \subsection{Default 90\% intervals}{
#' We default to reporting \eqn{90}\% intervals rather than \eqn{95}\% intervals
#' for several reasons:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item Computational stability: \eqn{90}\% intervals are more stable than
#'  \eqn{95}\% intervals (for which each end relies on only \eqn{2.5}\% of the
#'  posterior draws). \item Relation to Type-S errors (Gelman and Carlin, 2014):
#'  \eqn{95}\% of the mass in a \eqn{90}\% central interval is above the lower
#'  value (and \eqn{95}\% is below the upper value). For a parameter
#'  \eqn{\theta}, it is therefore easy to see if the posterior probability that
#'  \eqn{\theta > 0} (or \eqn{\theta < 0}) is larger or smaller than \eqn{95}\%.
#' }
#' Of course, if \eqn{95}\% intervals are desired they can be computed by
#' specifying \code{prob=0.95}.
#' }
#' \subsection{Types of intervals}{
#' Currently \code{posterior_interval} only computes central intervals because
#' other types of intervals are rarely useful for the models that \pkg{rstanarm}
#' can estimate. Additional possibilities may be provided in future releases as
#' more models become available.
