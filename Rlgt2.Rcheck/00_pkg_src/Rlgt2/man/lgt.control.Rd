}
\arguments{
\item{MAX_RHAT_ALLOWED}{Maximum average Rhat that suggests a good fit, see Stan's manual. Suggested range(1.005,1.02), see also MAX_NUM_OF_REPEATS description below.}

\item{NUM_OF_ITER}{Number of iterations for each chain. Suggested range(1000,5000). Generally, the longer the series, the smaller the vallue will do. 
See also MAX_NUM_OF_REPEATS description below.}

\item{MAX_NUM_OF_REPEATS}{Maximum number of the sampling procedure repeats if the fit is unsatisfactorily (avgRHat>MAX_RHAT_ALLOWED).
Each round doubles the number of iterations. Suggested range(2,4)}

\item{CAUCHY_SD_DIV}{For parameters with non-obvious range Cauchy distribution is used. The error size of this distribution 
is calculated by dividing max value of the time series by this constant. Suggested range(100,300)}

\item{MIN_SIGMA}{Minimum size of the fitted sigma, applied for numerical stability. Must bve positive.}

\item{MIN_NU}{Minimum degrees of freedom of the Student's distribution, that is used in most models. Suggested range(1.2, 5)}

\item{MAX_NU}{Maximum degrees of freedom of the Student's distribution. Suggested range(15,30)}

\item{MIN_POW_TREND}{Minimum value of power of trend coefficient. Suggested range(-1,0)}

\item{MAX_POW_TREND}{Maximum value of power of trend coefficient. It should stay 1 to allow the model to approach exponential growth when needed.}

\item{POW_TREND_ALPHA}{Alpha parameter of Beta distribution that is the prior of the power coefficient in the formula of trend parameter.
To make the forecast more curved, make it larger. Suggested range(1,6)}

\item{POW_TREND_BETA}{Beta parameter of Beta distribution that is the prior of the power of trend parameter. 1 by default, see also above.}

\item{POW_SIGMA_ALPHA}{Alpha parameter of Beta distribution that is the prior of the power coefficient in the formula of the error size. 1 by default, see also below.}

\item{POW_SIGMA_BETA}{Beta parameter of Beta distribution that is the prior of the power coefficient in the formula of the error size.
If the powSigma fitted is considered too often too high (i.e.> 0.7) you can attempt to tame it down by increasing POW_SIGMA_BETA.  Suggested range(1,4).
ADAPT_DELTA Target Metropolis acceptance rate. See Stan manual. Suggested range (0.8-0.97). 
MAX_TREE_DEPTH NUTS maximum tree depth. See Stan manual. Suggested range (10-12).}

\item{ADAPT_DELTA}{Description
Setting it negative makes negative innovations having smaller impact on the fitting than the positive ones,
which would have the effect of making a model "more optimistic". Suggested range (-0.5, 0.5).}

\item{MAX_TREE_DEPTH}{Description}

\item{SEASONALITY}{E.g. 12 for monthly seasonality. 1 for non-seasonal models}

\item{SKEW}{Skew of error distribution used by manually-skewed models. 0 be default.}

\description{
This is a function that initializes and sets the parameters of the algorithm. 
It generates a list of parameters, to be used with the \code{\link{fit.lgt}} function.
