Description: An implementation of a number of Global Trend models for time series forecasting 
    that are Bayesian generalizations and extensions of some Exponential Smoothing models. 
    The main differences/additions include 1) nonlinear global trend, 2) Student-t error 
    distribution, and 3) a function for the error size, so heteroscedasticity. The methods 
    are particularly useful for short time series. When tested on the well-known M3 dataset,
    they are able to outperform all classical time series algorithms. The models are fitted 
    with MCMC using the 'rstan' package.
