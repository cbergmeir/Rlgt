Description: This package provides implementation of a number of Global Trend models 
		that are Bayesian generalizations and extensions of some Exponential Smoothing models. 
		The main differences/additions include:
		- nonlinear global trend 
		- Student-t error distribution
		- function for the error size, so heteroscedasticity
		The are particularly useful for short time series. When tested on M3 dataset 
		they outperform all classical time series algorithms.
    The models are fitted with MCMC using rstan package.
