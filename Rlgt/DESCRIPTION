Description: An implementation of various Bayesian Exponential Smoothing (ETS) models which
    have been found to outperform all of the original models in the M3 competition.
    These models include LGT (Local-Global Trend), SGT (Seasonal Global Trend), and
    their variations. The Bayesian model fitting is based on the RStan package.
