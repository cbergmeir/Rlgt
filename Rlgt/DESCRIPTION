Description: An implementation of various innovative Bayesian ETS models which have been found to outperform all of the original models in M3-competition.
    These models include LGT (Local-Global Trend), SGT (Seasonal Global Trend), and their variations. The Bayesian model fitting is
    based on RStan package. Detailed information can be found on ...
