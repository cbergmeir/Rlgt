LGT_M3 Runs through a subset of M3 yearly data, showing two methods of passing the non-seasonal series data.
LGT&SGT_REG Runs LGT and SGT forecast with and without a regression component.
LGT&SGT_M3 Using M3 series, it demos several possibilities or sub-versions of seasonal and non-seasonal models.
LGT&SGT	Implementation of LGT and SGT models on the R buit-in datasets.
S2GT_M4 It demos several ways of passing data to dual seasonality models, and several dual seasonality models, using M4 hourly data set.
