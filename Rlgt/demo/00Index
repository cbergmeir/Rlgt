LGT_M3 Runs through a subset of M3 yearly data, showing two methods of passing the non-seasonal series data.
LGT_REG Runs LGT forecast with and without a regression component.
LGT&SGT_M3 Using M3 series, it demos several possibilities or sub-versions of seasonal and non-seasonal models
LGT&SGT	Implementation of LGT and SGT models on the R buit-in datasets
S2GT_M4 It demos several ways of passing data to dual seasonality models, and several dual seasonality models, using M4 hourly data set.
S2GT_M4Hourly_parallel Parallel implementation of S2GT (and occasionally SGT) models on hourly time-series of M4-competition dataset
SGT_M3 It uses quarterly subset of M3 data to demo ways of passing seasonal data
SGT_M3parallel Parallel implementation of SGT model on monthly time-series data from M3-competition dataset
SGT_M4Weekly_parallel Parallel implementation of SGT model with non-integer seasonality on weekly time-series data from M4-competition dataset
SGT_REG Runs SGT forecast with and without a regression component.
